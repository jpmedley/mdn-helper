# mdn-helper
Removes repetitive work of creating MDN markup and text. Much of the work of creating a new MDN reference page is in creating  boilerplate such as headings, specification tables, and standardized intro text. Once this is created API specific content must be added to the boilerplate. A significant portion of that content is duplicated between one or more pages of the API.

This tool simplifies this process. First, it takes a command line indicating the interfaces and members to be created. It then prompts the answers to API specific content. It combines those answers with templates and writes nearly complete pages ready for pasting directly into the MDN page editor.

The current version only handles JavaScript APIs.

## Installation

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org), version 10 or later.

1. Clone this repository.

   `git clone https://github.com/jpmedley/mdn-helper.git`

1. Change to the `mdn-helper` directory and run `npm install`.

1. Enter `npm run update-data` to download the IDL files needed for the `build`, `burn`, and `find` commands. This script will run automatically at startup approximately every twenty-four hours.

## Usage

From within the mdn-helper direcory:

  `npm run <command> [<arguments>] -- [<flags>]`

## Commands

### build

Searches Chrome's IDL files for filenames matching the provided string, prompts you to select a specific file, builds a JSON file for the [Browser compatibility Database](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data), the builds boilerplate pages formatted for publishing on MDN. Use `-i` or `--interactive` to interactively fill in missing information through a series of questions. Use `-j` or `--jsonOnly` to create a new JSON boilerplate for the browser compatibility data database, but no draft MDN pages.

**Syntax:** `build _searchString_ -- [(-i | --interactive)] [(-j | --jsonOnly)]`

For detailed instructions, see [Building MDN Pages](/help/BUILDING-PAGES.md).

### burn

Builds several types of burn-down lists. This has several syntaxes.

**Syntax:** `burn chrome -- [(-f | --flags)] [(-o | --origin-trials)] [(-w | --whitelist)]`

Generates a csv listing Chrome APIs that are lacking an MDN page. Use `-f` or `--flags` to include APIs behind a flag. Use `-o` or `--origin-trials` to include APIs currently in a Chrome origin trial. Use `-w` or `--whitelist` to include of list of interfaces to burn.

**Syntax:** `burn urls -- [(-c | --category) _category_]`

Generates a csv listing BCD entries that are lacking a corresponding MDN page. `_category_` must be one of 'api', 'css', 'html', 'javascript', or 'svg'. If you don't enter one of these values, you will be prompted for one of them.

**Syntax:** `burn bcd -- [(-c | --category) _category_] [(-b | --browsers) _browsers_]`

Generates a csv listing BCD entries where the browser value is either null or missing.

* `_category_` must be one of 'api', 'css', 'html', 'javascript', or 'svg'. If you don't enter one of these values, you will be prompted for one of them.
* `_browsers_` must be a comma-separated list of browsers. If you don't enter any browsers or one of the provided browser names is not valid, you will be prompted to select browsers from a list.

### clean

Deletes selected folders from the `*path/to*/mdn-helper/out/` directory.

**Syntax:** `clean`

### css

Creates a pages for a CSS property. The results are written to the `*path/to*/mdn-helper/out/` directory.

**Syntax:** `css -- -n _propertyName_`

**Flag:**

`-n`: The name of the css property being documented. This flag provides the CSS page\'s name.

### find

Searches Chrome's IDL files for filenames matching the provided string, prompts you to select a specific file, then displays the contents of that file.

**Syntax:** `find _searchString_ -- [(-p | --ping)]`

**Flag:**

`-p` or `--ping`: (Optional) Pings the MDN pages for the interface members and
display whether they exist.

### header

Creates pages for the provided HTTP header and directive names names. The results are written to the `*path/to*/mdn-helper/out/` directory. To build directive plages only, exclude the -H or --header flag.

**Syntax:** <code>header -- -n _headerName_ [(-H | --header)] [(-d | --directive) _directiveName_]</code>

**Flags:**

`-n`: The name of the header being documented. This flag provides the header\'s name for use in directive pages. It does not create an interface page.

At least one of the following:
* `-H` or `--header`: (Optional) Indicates that a header page *should be created*. If this flag is absent only directive pages will be created.
* `-d` or `--directive`: (Optional) The name of a directive being documented. This flag may be repeated as needed.

### interface

Creates pages for JavaScript platform APIs. The results are written to the `*path/to*/mdn-helper/out/` directory.

**Syntax:** <code>interface -n _interfaceName_ [-l] [-r] [-c] [(-e | --event) _eventName_] [(-h | --handler) _handlerName_] [(-m | --method) _methodName_] [(-p | --property) _propertyName_]</code>

**Flags:**

`-n`: The name of the interface being documented. This flag provides the interface\'s name for use in member pages. It does not create an overview, interface, or constructor page.

At least one of the following:
* `-l` or `--landing`: (Optional) Indicates that a [landing page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Structures/Page_types/API_landing_page_template) should be created.
* `-r` or `--reference`: (Optional) Indicates that an [interface reference page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Structures/Page_types/API_reference_page_template) should be created.
* `-c`: (Optional) Indicates that a [constructor page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Structures/Page_types/API_constructor_subpage_template) should be created.
* `-it`: (Optional) Indicates that pages for the functions of the *iterable* IDL type will be created, specifically entries(), forEach(), keys(), and values().
* `-mp`: (Optional) Indicates that pages for the functions of the *maplike* IDL type will be created.
* `-mr`: (Optional) Indicates that pages for the functions of the *readonly maplike* IDL type will be created.
* `-e` or `--event`: (Optional) Indicates that an *event* page should be created with the specified name. This flag may be repeated as needed.
* `-h` or `--handler`: (Optional) Indicates that an [event handler page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Structures/Page_types/API_event_handler_subpage_template) should be created with the specified name. This flag may be repeated as needed.
* `-m` or `--method`: (Optional) Indicates that a [method page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Structures/Page_types/API_method_subpage_template) should be created with the specified name. This flag may be repeated as needed.
* `-p` or `--property`: (Optional) Indicates that a [property page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Structures/Page_types/API_property_subpage_template) should be created with the specified name. This flag may be repeated as needed.

## update-data

Downloads a new set of IDL files for use by the `build`, `burn`, and `find` commands. This command will run automatically either daily or weekly depending on the value set in your config file. Use `-f` or `--force` to update data sooner.

### help

Prints help text to the console.

## Examples

**Create an interface page only**

`node index.js interface -n Widget -i`

**Create an interface page and a constructor page**

`node index.js interface -n Widget -i -c`

**Create a method page without its interface**

`node index.js interface -n Widget -m "doStuff()"`

**Create an interface page and two members**

`node index.js interface -n Widget -m "doStuff()" -p isReady`

## configuration

When installed, no configuration is needed. [Instructions are provided](help/CONFIGURING.md) for a few options that you may want to change.
