The **`[[shared:interface]].size()`** method returns the number of elements in the [[shared:interface]] object.

## Syntax

```js
size();
```

### Parameters

None.

### Return value

A number.

## Examples

Fill in a simple example that nicely shows a typical usage of the API, then perhaps some more complex examples (see our guide on how to add [code examples](/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Structures/Code_examples) for more information).

This text should be replaced with a brief description of what the example demonstrates.

```js
my code block
```

If you've included an example directly in the page as shown above, and that example is longer than 4-5 lines or so, consider following the example with a step-by-step explanation of what it's doing, so that new programmers can learn more easily, and to help smooth the learning curve for complicated subjects.

And/or include a list of links to useful code samples that live elsewhere:

*   y
*   z
