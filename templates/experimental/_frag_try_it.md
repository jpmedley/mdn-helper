### Try the [[name]]

During the trial phase you can test the API by one of two methods.

#### Local testing

To experiment with the Launch Handler API locally, without an origin trial token, enable the `[[flagName]]` flag in `about://flags`.

#### Register for the origin trial

Starting in Chromium [[originTrialStart]], the Launch Handler API will be available as an [origin trial](/docs/web-platform/origin-trials/) in Chromium. The origin trial is expected to end in Chromium [[originTrialEnd]] ([[originTrialEndDate]]). [Register here](https://developers.chrome.com/origintrials/#/trials/active).
