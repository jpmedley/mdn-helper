<p class="summary">The summary paragraph — start by naming the API, and saying what it is used for. This should ideally be 1 or 2 short sentences.</p>

<h2>[[shared:formalAPIName]] Concepts and Usage</h2>

<p>In this section, describe the API's purpose and usage cases in a bit more detail — why was a need recognized for it? What problems does it solve? What concepts does it involve? How do you use it, from a high level perspective?</p>

<p>Don't go into a lot of detail in this section, and don't include code examples. If there are a lot of concepts to explain to explain around this API, you should explain them in a separate "Concepts..." article (e.g. <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API/Concepts">WebVR concepts</a>). For a practical usage guide with code examples, you should include a "Usage..." article in your API docs (e.g. <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API/Using_the_WebVR_API">Using the WebVR API</a>).</p>

<p>To help improve content discoverability and {{Glossary("SEO")}}, keep the following tips in mind:</p>

<h2 id="Interfaces">[[shared:formalAPIName]] Interfaces</h2>

<dl>
 <dt>{{domxref('')}}</dt>
 <dd>Include a brief description of the interface and what it does here. Include one term and definition for each interface or dictionary.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Interfaces">[[shared:formalAPIName]] mixins</h3>

<dl>
 <dt>{{domxref('')}}</dt>
 <dd>Include a brief description of the mixin and what it does here. Include one term and definition for each mixin. If there are no mixins in this API, delete this section.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Interfaces">Extensions to other interfaces</h3>

<p>The [[shared:formalAPIName]] extends the following APIs, adding the listed features.</p>

<h4 id="Interface_1">Interface #1</h4>

<dl>
 <dt>{{domxref('')}}</dt>
 <dd><dfn>Description of the feature of Interface#1 that is added to that API by the API you are currently documenting. One </dfn>term and definition for each feature. If this API doesn't extend any other interfaces, you can delete these sections.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Fill in a simple example that nicely shows a typical usage of the API, then perhaps some more complex examples (see our guide on how to add <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Structures/Code_examples">code examples</a> for more information).</p>

<p>This text should be replaced with a brief description of what the example demonstrates.</p>

<p>If you've included an example directly in the page as shown above, and that example is longer than 4-5 lines or so, consider following the example with a step-by-step explanation of what it's doing, so that new programmers can learn more easily, and to help smooth the learning curve for complicated subjects.</p>

<p>And/or include a list of links to useful code samples that live elsewhere:</p>
