## [[shared:formalAPIName]] Concepts and Usage

In this section, describe the API's purpose and usage cases in a bit more detail â€” why was a need recognized for it? What problems does it solve? What concepts does it involve? How do you use it, from a high level perspective?

Don't go into a lot of detail in this section, and don't include code examples. If there are a lot of concepts to explain to explain around this API, you should explain them in a separate "Concepts..." article (e.g. [WebVR concepts](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API/Concepts)). For a practical usage guide with code examples, you should include a "Usage..." article in your API docs (e.g. [Using the WebVR API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API/Using_the_WebVR_API)).

## Examples

Fill in a simple example that nicely shows a typical usage of the API, then perhaps some more complex examples (see our guide on how to add [code examples](/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Structures/Code_examples) for more information).

This text should be replaced with a brief description of what the example demonstrates.

<pre class="brush: js">my code block</pre>

If you've included an example directly in the page as shown above, and that example is longer than 4-5 lines or so, consider following the example with a step-by-step explanation of what it's doing, so that new programmers can learn more easily, and to help smooth the learning curve for complicated subjects.

And/or include a list of links to useful code samples that live elsewhere:
