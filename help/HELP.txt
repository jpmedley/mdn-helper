  build css searchString
  build idl searchString -- [(-i | --interactive)] [(-j | --jsonOnly)] [(-l | --landingPage)]
    Builds an interfaces boilerplates after selecting an IDL file based on
    searchString. For interfaces, this also outputs BCD if a file doesn't exist.
    Use -i or --interactive to interactively fill in missing information through
    a series of questions. Use -j or --jsonOnly to create a new JSON boilerplate
    for the browser compatibility data database, but no draft MDN pages. Use -l
    or --landingPage to create only a landing page.

  burn bcd -- [(-c | --category) _category_] [(-b | --browsers) browsers] [(-r | --reportinglist) reportinglist]
  burn chrome  -- [(-f | --flags)] [(-i | --interfaces-only)] [(-o | --origin-trials)] [(-r | --reportinglist) reportinglist]
  burn urls -- [(-c | --category) category]
    Builds several types of burn-down lists.

    The first syntax generates a csv listing BCD entries where the browser
    value is either null or missing. 'category must be one of 'api', 'css',
    'html', 'javascript', or 'svg'. If you don't enter one of these values, you
    will be prompted for one of them.

    The second generates a csv listing Chrome APIs that are lacking an MDN page.
    Use -f or --flags to include APIs behind a flag. Use -i or --interfaces-only
    run a report containing only interfaces. Use -o or --origin-trials to
    include APIs currently in a Chrome origin trial. Use -r or --reportinglist to
    include of list of interfaces to burn.

    The last generates a csv listing BCD entries that are lacking a
    corresponding MDN page.

  clean
    Deletes selected folders from the *path/to*/mdn-helper/out/ directory.

  css -- -n propertyName
    Creates a page for a CSS property. The results are written to the
    *path/to*/mdn-helper/out/ directory.

  find css searchString
  find idl searchString [(-p | --ping)]
    Searches Chrome's IDL files for interfaces matching the provided string,
    prompts you to select a specific interface, then displays the interface. Use
    -p or --ping to ping the MDN pages for the interface members and display
    whether they exist.

  header -- -n headerName [(-H | --header)] [(-d | --directive) directiveName]
    Creates pages for the provided HTTP header and directive names
    names. The results are written to the *path/to*/mdn-helper/out/
    directory. To build directive plages only, exclude the -H or --header flag.

  interface -- -n _interfaceName_ [-l] [-r] [-it] [-mp] [-mr]
  [(-e | --event) _eventName_] [(-h | --handler) _handlerName_]
  [(-m | --method) _methodName_] [(-p | --property) _propertyName_]
  [(-w | --writefiles)]
    Creates pages for JavaScript platform APIs. The results are written to the
    *path/to*/mdn-helper/out/ directory.

  update-data
    Downloads a new set of IDL files for use by the `build`, `burn`, and `find`
    commands. This command will run automatically either daily or weekly
    depending on the value set in your config file. Use `-f` or `--force` to
    update data sooner.

  help
    Prints help text to the console.

The README file provides more details including full descriptions of the flags.
