# Development notes

NOT FOR RELEASE VERSION

## Feature: Question types

* String - Examples include most of what's there now.
* Enum - Example: `readOnly` would ask 'Is this item read only? Yes or No?' but would render 'read-only' or '' (empty string) respectively.
* Conditional

## New commands

`validate`: Validates that question files contain the same keys.
